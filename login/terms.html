    <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>

    <p>
        Welcome to <strong>FuelShare</strong>. By using this platform, you agree to the following terms.
        Please read them carefully.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Platform Purpose</h2>
    <p>
        FuelShare is a ride‑sharing coordination platform designed to help users share rides
        and reduce fuel costs. We do not provide transportation services.
    </p>

    <h2>2. User Responsibility</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Users are responsible for their own safety and decisions.</li>
        <li>All ride arrangements are made voluntarily between users.</li>
        <li>The platform is not responsible for disputes or incidents.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Identity & Trust</h2>
    <p>
        Users must upload a valid driving licence for trust purposes only.
        Documents are not publicly visible.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Payments</h2>
    <p>
        FuelShare does not handle payments. Any cost sharing is done mutually
        between users outside the platform.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Usage</h2>
    <p>
        Personal data is used only for platform functionality and is not shared
        with third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>
        These terms may be updated in the future. Continued use of the platform
        indicates acceptance of updated terms.
